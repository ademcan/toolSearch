# toolSearch

## How to use

1. Clone the repository in your ~/bin folder (or any other folder you like)
```
cd ~/bin
git clone https://github.com/ademcan/toolSearch
```
2. make toolSearch executable (in case it isn't yet)
```
cd toolSearch
chmod +x toolSearch
```
3. add your toolSearch directory to your PATH (this way you can use toolSearch from everywhere). The best is to add it to your .bashrc so you don't have to do this step everytime you connect.
```
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```
4. Enjoy
